# image_classification_pipeline

Purpose of this task was to classify color images using supervised machine learning algorithms. Different features were extracted from these images and used to perform multi-class classification with well known machine learning algorithms.

The data used in this task was 60 RGB images from 3 different classes of images: pebbles, sky and tree images. Every image was flipped horizontally this doubled the size of data into a total of 360 images. The images were also turned into grayscale to be used for feature extraction.

In this task methods used were based on supervised machine learning. The data was applied on different classifiers like K nearest neighbors, ridge regression and multi-layer perceptron. Performance of these classifiers was then estimated using nested cross-validation.
